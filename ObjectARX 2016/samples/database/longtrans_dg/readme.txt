Description:

This sample program shows how to use long transactions.

1. Build and Load the ObjectARX application.
2. Command: LONGTRANS 
3. Choose a drawing that contains line entities.
4. The program will check out the line entities from the drawing you chose and bring them into the current model space.  
5. The program will then ask for a color (integer) and change these entities within the workset.  
6. Finally it will pause to let you see the new color (just hit return).
7. After the pause, the entities will be checked back into the orginal database and saved. 

Open the original database and see the new colors that were modified by the previous databse in the reference editing operation.
