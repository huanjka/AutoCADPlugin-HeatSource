Description:

This program demonstrates iterating over a symbol table. In this example, the linetype table is used.

Refer to the ObjectARX Developer's Guide for more information.

1. Start AutoCAD and open a new drawing.
2. Type the ARX command and load tbliter.arx.
3. Type the ITERATE command, defined by tbliter.arx.

Note: Unless you have loaded additional linetypes, tbliter.arx will list the three default linetype table records: BYBLOCK, BYLAYER, and CONTINUOUS.
