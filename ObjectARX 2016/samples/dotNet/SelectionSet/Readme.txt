This sample demonstrates the basics of using the Selectionset .NET API with AutoCAD.  It has the following commnads:

       all entities other than circles that are red in color.

Single - This command allows only a single entity to be picked

Implied - This command demonstrates Implied pick

SSetReactors - This command demonstrates some selection Related input context 
               reactors. It exercises promptingForSelection, PromptedForSelection 
               and SelectionAdded events of the editor.

               selection Results that we had during the execution of SSetReactors 
               command. It demonstrates how to use PromptingForSelection and 
               PromptedForSelection events.

To run the sample:  Build the application adding acdbmgd.dll and acmgd.dll as references, and use NETLOAD command to load selectionset.dll from the \bin subfolder.
