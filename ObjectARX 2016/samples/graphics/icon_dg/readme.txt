Description:

viewportDraw() (window coordinates)

This example demonstrates the main use of polylineDc(), polygonDc(), and getViewportDcCorners() -- graphics that depend on the physical layout of the viewport, like icons, markers, or borders that vary with the size of the viewport.

For the demonstration, this example draws a box in the upper right corner of the viewport. The box's width and height are always a tenth of the viewport's shortest dimension and are centered a tenth of the viewport's shortest dimension down and to the left of the upper right corner of the viewport.

Procedure:
1. Load icon.arx.
2. Command: ASDKICONSAMP
3. Command: TILEMODE 0
4. Command: MVIEW
   ON/OFF/Hideplot/Fit/2/3/4/Restore/<First Point>:
   Select First Point and Other Corner

You should see a red rectangular shape in the upper right corner proportional to the viewport.
   
The ObjectARX Developer's Guide and the source code explain what took place in more detail.
